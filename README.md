# NbaBrackets

This project provides a simple website for creating NBA team brackets. It lets you:

- Rank all 30 teams for the regular season by dragging them into order.
- Pick winners through the playoff rounds until a champion is decided.

To use the site, open `index.html` in a web browser. Rankings are saved to `localStorage` so they persist across visits.
